## Description

We have been made aware that the platform “NCC open data” is largely underutilised. With the most frequent tags being “transport” and “services” we have established that an application could be made to provide the public of Nottingham with fruitful advice and guidance about the city from the information derived from the datasets. By the means of creating the interactive educational app “Adventurer's Guide to Nottingham” we have utilised the data to create something innovative and unique.

Our team has designed an inclusive app that appeals to all, including all ages, those new to the city, and those familiar. We offer the user the option to traverse through the app by choosing a “mode”, such as kids or normal, with each mode being heavily discerned from the other.
